## Executive Summary 
In The final Lab being Lab 8 I will take I finally look in the class of IT1025 with learning about types of data. I will even go back to learn a bit about python again with SQL. I learn to make an SQL and what it is and the types of data, information, and knowledge on the internet.
## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data-These are the pure facts of the system either being quantitative or qualitative.
Information-These uses data to make context or purpose
Knowledge-there are two ways to look at knowledge these being explicit knowledge which is knowledge put into words or numbers or knowledge can be seen in what a human belief are.
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
The customer is like tables because each customer has their own set things, they want that define the customer.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The primary key is just a collection of records is a unique number.
### Field Data Types
It is important for the data to be correct so that the performance improves, and integrity is in the right database.
### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume-This is the size of the data
Variety-The form the data is taking.
Velocity-Speed of the data is generated at.
Variability-The amount the data is consentient.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Social media has pushed big data the biggest.
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
Data that is stored into a table is used in SQL.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
They are treats because they can destroy your database and used in most common web hacking sadly but can be reduce by using SQL parameters.
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
The code of ethics purpose is to set an acceptable behavior for people that they agree to and ACM created code ethics to give an outline for people.
### Intellectual Property
It’s important to copyright something so your originated idea isn’t stolen to give someone else money off your idea.
### Information Collection
They allow not the kid to make the decision but their parental figure to give information out on the internet.
## Conclusion
At the end of my finally lab of IT1025 I found myself to easy it gets it done not saying I didn’t have trouble on somethings. When it came to SQL I for sure Had some trouble with it and still do. I over come most of the trouble I had with SQL by just re reading and going to various sources about SQL then just the one given to me.
