## Executive Summary 
In lab 6 I will take a deeper dive into networking. With learning the differences between ipv6 and ipv4 and what they truly mean. I learn some fundamentals of how the internet and how searching things on the web just work.
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol

#### IP Address
The Ip is a number given to the computers network interface. Computers use IPâ€™s for sending data to the correct location.
Ipv4 is a 32-bit Ip and ipv6 is a 128-bit Ip address.
#### ICANN
The internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a group of non-profit people who provide maintenance to a couple of databases.
### TCP/IP
Transmission control protocol or internet protocol is a networking protocol that defines how the data is being sent.
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
It is the most used internet protocol and is supported on all computer software.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
Client is connecting to the sever using an Ip address and the sever is listening for connections.
#### Layers
It gives each layer its own separate function.
#### Application Layer
Application Layer
SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SNMP.
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is a web application layer protocol that is on the more client side of things. The HTML is request by the client and the server responses with the HTML pages.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
The protocol is called HTTPS or Hypertext transfer protocol secure  is just where it buts encryption on the data.
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
You can get things like spyware on your computer without evening knowing you got it.
### Risk Explained
ActiveX allows download an object but allows you to become more hacked as any of this downloads can be hacks.
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the world wide web made to bringe stakeholders.

Mobile web is important because it allows us to us the web anywhere on the go.
### HTML5 and CSS
They provide web designers to make a more refined and accurate web pages.
### HTML and XML
XML focus more on the transfer of the data where HTML is more a more focused version of the presentation of data.
## Components of a URL
Scheme=https
Domain=www.amazon.com
Top level domain=.edu
Default page=specific location on a page
Parameters=result of search
Anchor=no file path provided
## Conclusion
In Lab 6 I have learned the basics of just how the internet connects me to web pages using domain names and my Ip address. I also learned all about each layer of the internet. Also, what exactly the search bar on my screen is and how to read it.
