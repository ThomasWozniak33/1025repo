## Executive Summary 
In lab 5 I will learn the fundamentals of networking and its hardware with it. What data transmission, Ip address, network topologies, etc. Not only networking but how people protect are internet and the ways they attack it with Cybersecurity.

## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission

#### Packet: Unit of data 
#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address: Unique identifying number
#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
On a switch you get more bandwidth. A hub gives you a portent of the bandwidth the switch gives you all 100%.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Hubs and switches need components to make a local network where a router doesn’t its already there.
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
Single point of failure is just a flaw in the topologies examples of these can be a problem with the configuration, implementation of a system, and circuit.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
Infrastructure network: This a network that extends wired Lan so it can have wireless devices
Wireless Mesh: Multiple devices around an area that make a single Wi-Fi-network
I think that a wireless mesh is better because they are like extenders, and you can get Wi-Fi where you usually can’t.
### Network Design

### NSA/CSS
This are cyber security professionals that protect government IT system and severs to stop eavesdropping.
## Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Information Systems Security
#### Security Triad
Confidentiality: People not stealing others personal information like Ip address or home address.
Integrity: The salesperson page where they edit there products price and description and not letting people change the sellers prices.
Availability: Getting sales number for the day
#### Authentication
1)Phone pin code
2)Student number 
3)login into pc
#### ACL and RBAC
ACL: attribute control list is a list of permissions.
Pro-Isolate system from worms and malware.
Con-More overhead in management by personnel.
RBAC: Role-based access control is restricting system access.
Pro-less error prone
Con-Labor-intensive setup
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
Ciphertext: Encryption on plaintext using algorithm.
Public key: Large numerical value for encrypt data that generates a key avaible to everyone
Private key: just like a public key but for specific people given access
#### Public Key Cryptography
You can send messages back not just get them.
### Cryptography
#### Encryption
This is when you secure data with things like pins or passwords.
#### Frequency Fingerprint
Looks for the origin of a radio signal by using the properties of the transmission and specific radio frequencies if they can.
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
It’s a cipher that is all about substitution that uses letters.
#### Polyalphabetic Example
The Vigenère cipher
#### Brute-Force
When someone one usually an attacker sends many passwords to get in to something hoping one of the passwords are corrected.
## Conclusion
In Lab 5 I learned the basics of Networking and its other counterpart Cybersecurity. Can’t say I enjoyed this one because I hate networking since Highschool but the lab did provide a good break down of things like encryption and the simple terms of it.
