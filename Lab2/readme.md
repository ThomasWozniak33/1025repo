## Executive Summary 
In this Lab I will have learned about the Hardware side of computing and things like Binary code. The hardware part of computer such as RAM, CPU, and storage devices and how they differ from one each other. Then with the other side learning how to read Binary and turn it into Hexadecimal.
## Hardware
Hardware is the more physical part of the computer this includes things such as the case wires the things you can touch and feel.
### Hard Drives and Memory
These are what you need to download application and such on the computer and store it into
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is a time delay and transfer rates are going to be the speed a form a data transfer
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
The difference between a hard drive and an SSD is that the SSD makes almost no noise and has no spinning parts in it like a hard drive would.
#### Random Access Memory
Ram for short is speed of the computer that stores short term memory or memory that deletes itself.
### ALU and the Control Unit
Alu performs arithmetic and bitwise operations with binary numbers the CPU and gnu use this.
### CPU, Input & Output
This is the brain of the computer that handle the instructions in take these inputs (a command going in) and outputs (a command going out).
### Logic Gates 
A model of computation that works with using one or more binary functions.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
This is an association in New Jersey and New York that is for electronic and electrical engineering.
## Data Representation
This is saying the way the form the data is taking these can be the data being stored, processing, and transmitted
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Binary is data in represented in 0 and 1s. Hexadecimal is an easier way to translate or write binary. A decimal is a base of ten.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
This code uses colors in an RGB and combining them.
## Conclusion
At the end of Lab 2 I have learned how hexadecimal and binary work with and its 8-bit system of doing things. I also noticed the importance of a CPU and RAM are to your computer. Even the associations IEEE and what they do for the IT world.
