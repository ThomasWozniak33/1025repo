## Executive Summary 
In lab 7 I will learn about more of python and file compression. Ion the last couple of labs I have learned bit and parts of python and now I will grow on that knowledge. Lastly a deeper dive into of compression with files.
## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
Itâ€™s a folder of files that function as one file so instead of sending multiple files you send one zipped file.
### Compression and File Size
If the picture were a jpeg, it would have less of a size compared to the PNG because jpeg is a lossy file type that discards parts of the image.
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:A blueprint that defines an object or creates it.
### Methods:A special kind of function within the class. The method of the shark class is the constructor method.
### Constructor:The constructor is used to initialize data.
### Class vs. Object
A class is just a template where an object has its own values you define.
## Object Oriented Concepts

### Instantiated Objects
Creating a copy, a shark class with all the methods and variables.
### Inheritance
Reduces the labor by using a more common object an example of this would be a real object.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction is the behavior of a real word object and encapsulation is the binding of data and hiding them.
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
At the end of lab 7 I have learned the differences PNG and jpeg again and the purpose of why I should compress files. I also learned what a class vs an object is and how shark class fits into it.
