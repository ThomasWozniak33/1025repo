## Executive Summary 
In lab 3 not only do you learn about software but coding a bit. It will show me the types of software and what to do with the knowledge given to me from this course into the IT world.
## Software
### Types of Software
Application-This the second most use full category of software. This are used for a certain goal to be conducted. These can be things like Word processing, Spreadsheets, and presentation.
OS-This is something all computer required and the first thing that is booted up. It manages things like application software. There are different OS like Linux an open source, Mac OS, Windows 10, and Chrome OS.
Utility-These is a type of program that allows you to change something in your computer. Examples of this are anti-malware/Virus that remove unwanted software. Also, these utilities can include things such as writing code.
### ERP
Stands for Enterprise Resource Planning and is a program for large or small organizations together. Examples of this are software applications, utilizes a central database, and Implemented organization-wide.
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Helped reduce vendor lock-in
### Role of Hypervisor
Separates physical resources form he virtual ones
## Python

### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
This an AI for programmers develop algorithms they have rules like
like
Initial capitalized words, one statement per line, Indent to show Hierarchy, and simple.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
Compiled go right into machine code and tend to be faster yet an interpreted languages are a bit slower and have to go through a program beside going right to machine code.
## Career Exploration
### Handshake
On handshake I thought it was very cool and super useful to get the whole tri-c experience and go forward in my career. I see some jobs in my field and career fairs.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I found it useful a bit not as much as handshake. It was a bit confusing to use and looked outdated.
### Certifications
I found some certifications I know about and have vouchers for and hate like networking like CompTIA, network+, Cisco. But programming certifications and A+ I do like and would get into.
### Certificates and Degrees
A+,Cisco,Network+, and comptia
### Co-ops / Internships
Make resume to handshake
Work with employer relations specialist agreement
Sign cooperative education agreement
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I going to have to pick IEEE as the fact of IEEE bigging so big and making such an impact on tech today.
## Conclusion
At the end of the lab 3 I learned the fundamentals of software such as what an OS is and Virtualization helps us out. Not only that but what python is and the two types of coding. The best part about the lab is learning to take my career path outside of class into clubs and internships.
